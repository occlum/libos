# Code Coverage

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/occlum/occlum/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=FS22ULGGRC)](https://codecov.io/gh/occlum/occlum)

Occlum is written in different languages. Only *Rust* code coverage is enabled,
currently. Besides, the coverage data is only collected during `make test` and
`make test-glibc`. Adding more tests will improve the coverage data.
